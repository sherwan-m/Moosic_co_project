# Moosic_co_project
Moosic is a little start up that creates curated playlists done by music experts and specialists in old and new trends. Users can subscribe to their website and listen to these playlists through their preferred Music App (be it Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube Music…). They love the fact that their playlists have a personal touch, and that each playlist encapsulates a certain “mood” or “style”.  But business is scaling up fast and the music experts are slow in creating new playlists. They have hired you with a clear mission: use Data Science to add a degree of automatisation to the creation of playlists.
